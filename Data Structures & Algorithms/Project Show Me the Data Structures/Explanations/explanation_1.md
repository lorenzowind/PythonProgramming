### To create the LRU Cache, I used a Doubly Linked List - to ensure that I can access the previous and next node - and a Hash Map - to access any element using the key. Implementing these structures together is a way to perform get and set operations on the linked list by accessing any node with the key in time complexity of O(1). The space complexity is O(n), the LRU Cache capacity.
