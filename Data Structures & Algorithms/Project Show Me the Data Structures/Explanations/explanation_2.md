### To find all the files with specific endings in the folder, I implemented a recursive solution, going through the subdirectories and appending the paths in an array. All this process takes O(n) time complexity plus the number of elements in each subdirectory. The space complexity is also O(n), the amount of files and folders that are in the array.
