### To implement the Huffman Coding algorithm, I used in the encoding process, an array of tuples to find the frequencies and the characters, and then a tree to structure all the elements (compressing the data - the size as well), creating the binary message during the tree construction. Finally, in the decoding process, I traversed into the tree going through the leafs, following the message's unique codes and discovering the original content. So, to encode takes O(n + m) - the array of tuples and an auxiliary dictionary to count the frequencies - plus O(n * m) - the number of characters in the message and the distance to the leaf. Similarly, to decode takes O(n * m) to traverse the tree, recreating the message.
