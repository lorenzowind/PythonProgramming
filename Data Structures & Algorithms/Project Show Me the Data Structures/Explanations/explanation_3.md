### To implement the Huffman Coding algorithm, I used in the encoding process, an array of tuples to find the frequencies and the characters, and then a tree to structure all the elements (compressing the data - the size as well), creating the binary message during the tree construction. Finally, in the decoding process, I traversed into the tree going through the leafs, following the message's unique codes and discovering the original content. So, to encode and decode takes both O(logn) to determine the heights and O(n) iterations for each character, that is a time complexity of O(logn * n) in total. The space complexity is O(k) - the number of leafs - and O(n) - the message length.
