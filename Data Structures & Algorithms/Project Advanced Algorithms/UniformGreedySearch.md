## A* Algorithm
- **Uniform Cost search** - expands out equally in all directions, may expend additional effort getting to a fairly direct path to the goal.
- **Greedy best-first search** - expands outward toward locations estimated as closer to the goal. If a direct path is available, expends much less effort than Uniform Cost; however, it does not consider any routes in which it may need to temporarily take a further away path in order to arrive at an overall shorter path.
- **A\* Search** - utilizes both of these. Follows: ```f = g + h```. It depends on the h function - h should never overestimate distance to goal.
