## Reasoning: To implement this algorithm, I used a variable and a temporary variable to store the divisions by 2 and the previous value, repectively. Finally, comparing in a loop to find the floored square root.

### Method `sqrt`

#### Time complexity: O(log(n))
#### Space complexity: O(1) 

## Overrall

### Time complexity: O(log(n))
### Space complexity: O(1)
