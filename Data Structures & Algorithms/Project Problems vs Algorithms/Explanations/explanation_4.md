## Reasoning: To sort the array of 0, 1 and 2, I implemented a dictionary to store the values as keys. Going through the whole array, I returned the dictionary items following the order.

### Method `sort_012`

#### Time complexity: O(n) 
#### Space complexity: O(n)

## Overrall

### Time complexity: O(n)
### Space complexity: O(n)
