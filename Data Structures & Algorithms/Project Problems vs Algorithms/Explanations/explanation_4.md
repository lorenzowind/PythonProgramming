## Reasoning: To sort the array of 0, 1 and 2, I implemented the following logic:
1. A dictionary to store the values as keys; 
2. Going through the whole array incrementing the values, considering the 0, 1 or 2 as the key; 
3. Returning the dictionary items following the order of keys: `dictionary[0] + dictionary[1] + dictionary[2]`.
