## Reasoning: To find the minimum and maximum values of an array sorting it, I used a simple approach to find them, just going through the array. To sorting, I implemented the Pigeonhole sort, considering the number of elements and the length of the range.

### Method `get_min_max`

#### Time complexity: O(n)
#### Space complexity: O(1)

### Method `pigeonhole_sort`

#### Time complexity: O(n + range)
#### Space complexity: O(n)

## Overrall

### Time complexity: O(n)
### Space complexity: O(n)
